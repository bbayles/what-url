This is ``what_url``, a Python library for parsing and joining URLs.

The library uses the `WHATWG URL standard <https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-parsing>`__ for parsing.
It uses `_CFFI <https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ to wrap the `_ada <https://github.com/ada-url/ada>`__
C/C++ library. This project is not affiliated with any of those.
